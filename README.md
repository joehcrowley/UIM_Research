# UIM_Research
# During the Spring semester of 2017, I worked alongside a professor and a graduate student looking at the problem of Utility Itemset Mining. In the process of Utility Itemset Datamining, we looked at the relationships items within transactions have with each other, and how we could push one item to customers to increase overall profit. This method can be applied to other topics, as long as the data comes with a utility metric that describes the relationship between the items.
# As part of my research, I have developed simple ways to find high utility itemsets, learned new ways to set up coding projects, and started learning a new coding language. Some of my work included developing a synthetic data generator and using the data from it to test an algorithm. The end goal of my research was to find what things influence peopleâ€™s ratings of products the most, whether that is price, quality, time of delivery, or other attributes of an item's sale.
# In this repository, you will see the code I used to aid me in my research. This collection is meant to serve as an example of my early days of coding. While these might not be the most efficient ways to generate and process data, I used the tools at my disposal at the time to reach my end goal.
