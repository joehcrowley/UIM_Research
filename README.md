# UIM_Research
A collection of resources I used during the Spring 2017 semester as part of my research in Utility Itemset Mining.
These are some of the first pieces of code that I made completely alone, and most can be optimized further.
Some of the pieces included are synthetic data generators, while others are used to count the frequencies of itemsets.
The output of these programs was provided to a graduate student to further his research in Utility Itemset Mining.
